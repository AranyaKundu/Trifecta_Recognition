## Image Recognition
This also has an image recognition feature. But I could not upload the model because of the file size and the train data privacy. I have uploaded the code for training the model instead. Any one can upload images and with simple tweaks in `directory`, `batch size`, `image height`, `image width`, `classnames`, `number of epochs` any one can fit a similar model and test with other images.
